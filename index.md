I am an MPhil Advanced Computer Science student at the University of Cambridge. I graduated from the University of York with a first class Computer Science BSc.

My interests include programming language theory and formal methods.

I wrote my undergraduate dissertation on an integration between Isabelle and Mathematica. You can find it [here.](./laursen2020.pdf)
